ISetting up WSO2 API Manager involves several steps, from downloading the software to configuring the necessary components for API creation, publishing, and management. Below is a step-by-step guide for installing and setting up WSO2 API Manager.

### Prerequisites:

1. **Operating System**: You can install WSO2 API Manager on various platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
2. **Java**: WSO2 API Manager requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11. You can install it via the following commands depending on your OS:
   - **Linux/MacOS**:  
     ```bash
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
     java -version
     ```
   - **Windows**: Download and install JDK 11 from the [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) websites.

3. **Database** (Optional): WSO2 API Manager uses an embedded H2 database by default. For production use, you may need external databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle.

4. **Memory**: Ensure that the system has at least 4GB of RAM.

### Step 1: Download and Extract WSO2 API Manager

1. Download the WSO2 API Manager distribution from the [WSO2 website](https://wso2.com/api-management/).
   
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file into a directory:
   ```bash
   unzip wso2am-<version>.zip -d /path/to/directory
   cd /path/to/directory/wso2am-<version>/
   ```

### Step 2: Start WSO2 API Manager

1. Navigate to the `<API_Manager_Home>/bin` directory.
   - On **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/wso2am-<version>/bin
     ./wso2server.sh
     ```
   - On **Windows**:
     ```
     cd C:\path\to\wso2am-<version>\bin
     wso2server.bat
     ```

2. Once started, WSO2 API Manager runs on the default port **9443**. It will take a few minutes to initialize.

3. Verify the service is running by opening a browser and navigating to:
   ```
   https://localhost:9443/carbon
   ```
   Use the default credentials:
   - **Username**: admin
   - **Password**: admin

### Step 3: Configure WSO2 API Manager

WSO2 API Manager’s configuration files can be found in the `<API_Manager_Home>/repository/conf` directory. Some important configuration files include:

- **deployment.toml**: This is the main configuration file where you can set up database connections, change ports, and other configurations.

#### Common Configurations:
1. **Changing Default Port**:
   - To change the default ports for HTTP (9763) and HTTPS (9443), open the `deployment.toml` file:
     ```toml
     [server]
     hostname = "localhost"
     http_port = 8080
     https_port = 8443
     ```

2. **Configuring External Databases**:
   - For production, it's recommended to replace the default H2 database with an external one like MySQL. To do this, first install your preferred database and configure the database connection details in `deployment.toml`:
     ```toml
     [database.apim_db]
     type = "mysql"
     url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/apim_db"
     username = "root"
     password = "password"
     ```

3. **Changing Admin Credentials**:
   - To change the default admin username and password, edit the `<API_Manager_Home>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file:
     ```toml
     [super_admin]
     username = "newadmin"
     password = "newpassword"
     ```

4. **Adding Users and Roles**:
   - You can manage users and roles via the admin console or by editing the user-mgt.xml configuration file.

### Step 4: Access API Publisher and Developer Portal

WSO2 API Manager provides two primary UIs:
- **API Publisher**: Used to create, publish, and manage APIs.
- **API Developer Portal**: Where consumers can discover, subscribe to, and test APIs.

1. **API Publisher**:  
   Navigate to the API Publisher interface to create and manage APIs:
   ```
   https://localhost:9443/publisher
   ```
   Use the same admin credentials (`admin/admin` by default) to log in.

2. **API Developer Portal**:  
   This is the interface where developers discover and subscribe to APIs:
   ```
   https://localhost:9443/devportal
   ```

### Step 5: Create an API

Once you have logged into the API Publisher portal, you can create your first API.

1. **Create API from URL**:
   - Go to **Create API** → **Design a New API**.
   - Enter details like the **API Name**, **Context**, **Version**, and **Endpoint URL**.
   - Define any security and resource policies for the API.
   
2. **Set up API Endpoints**:
   - Define the backend service URL or mock data for testing purposes.

3. **Publish API**:
   - Once the API is created and tested, click **Publish**. This makes the API available in the Developer Portal.

### Step 6: Subscribe and Test the API

After publishing the API:

1. Go to the **Developer Portal** and locate the newly published API.
2. Click **Subscribe** and generate an API key or token.
3. Use the **Try Out** feature to test the API directly in the portal.

You can also use tools like **Postman** or **Curl** to interact with the API using the access tokens generated.

### Step 7: Enable Analytics and Monitoring

1. **Enable Analytics**:  
   - WSO2 API Manager has built-in support for monitoring and analytics. You can enable analytics in the `deployment.toml` file by configuring the Analytics server.
   
   ```toml
   [apim.analytics]
   enable = true
   ```

2. **View Analytics**:  
   Once enabled, you can monitor API usage, performance, and errors through the API Analytics Dashboard available at:
   ```
   https://localhost:9443/analytics-dashboard
   ```

### Optional: Clustering and Deployment in Production

For production environments, you might want to set up WSO2 API Manager in a clustered setup for high availability and load balancing. WSO2 supports Kubernetes, Docker, and various cloud environments for scalable deployments.

- **Kubernetes Deployment**: WSO2 provides Helm charts and Docker images for deploying API Manager on Kubernetes.
- **Load Balancing**: Set up load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple API Gateway nodes.
- **Database Replication**: Use a clustered database setup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) to ensure high availability.

### Conclusion

WSO2 API Manager is a powerful, open-source platform for managing the entire lifecycle of your APIs. By following the steps above, you can set up a local instance, configure it for your environment, and begin publishing and managing APIs.
